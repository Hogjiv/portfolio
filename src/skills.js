      " I started studying web development a long time ago, but I havebeen actively engaged in it for the past two years. My interest inthis field began back in 2012 when I took courses in webprogramming fundamentals and started exploring web design.        However, at that time, my focus was more on 3D, so I returned to web development only two years ago. Since then, I have acquired many skills and can now help you create beautiful and fast websites. I am also interested in writing small scripts and  programs as personal projects.",

      " Although I haven’t been working in web design for long, nearly all the projects I’ve been involved in required creating designs from scratch and developing the site’s logic. This process is both fascinating and demanding! My programming skills significantly ease the work, as I see projects from both perspectives — as a designer and as a developer. This allows me to handle tasks both as a designer and as a developer, or to be a skilled designer who understands how the code works." },

  "I have been working with 3D graphics for over 10 years. My interest began back in school when we studied 3D graphics. I create virtually any type of 3D graphics, but my primary focus has been on game development, modeling, and architectural visualization. The world of 3D is very diverse and it’s impossible to master it all. Typically, an artist concentrates on one or two areas. Therefore, I do not work with animation, special effects, or characters, but offer services in the mentioned fields. I can also teach you 3D art, sharing my extensive experience." },
